# SimonSaysGame
The "Simon Says" game is a classic children's activity promoting listening and attention skills. One player, "Simon," gives commands starting with "Simon says," which players must follow. If Simon doesn't say "Simon says," players shouldn't act. Those who mistakenly follow incorrect commands are out, fostering quick thinking and focus.
